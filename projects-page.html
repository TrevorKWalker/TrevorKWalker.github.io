                                This Project is a fully functional website that I built from scratch to serve as a portfolio to share my personal coding projects with the world. This Project was coded from scratch using Html, CSS and JaveScript and was my first 
                                project that utilized these languages. It consist of 3 pages: A home page that has contact information and an About Me section, A projects page where you are veiwing this now that has a discription picture of each project that I 
                                have made along with what I learned from the project and finally a Travel page where I write blogs about my recent travels and vacations that I have went on.
                            </p>
                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                Being one of my first personal projects, there were unique challenges that presented themselves as I worked on the website. When beginning the project the thing I thought would be the biggest obstacle would be motivation since there 
                                was no real deadline of when it needed to be completed by. I thought that I was lose interest in the project and it would fall to the wayside. However that proved not to be an issue. I found it exciting to learn the new languages and
                                work on something where the progress was so easily visible. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                I learned how to be more effective in searching for help online and grew in my ability to learn on my own which I believe to be an important skill. I also gained a new appreciation for taking a break from the project and coming back 
                                with a fresh prospective. There were many times where I could find the way to format a section and then I took a break for 15 minutes as I went for a walk or grabbed a snack and then when I came back I was able to solve the problem
                                almost immediately.
