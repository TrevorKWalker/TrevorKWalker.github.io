                                This is a discord bot that creates scoreboards based off of league of legends stats for my discord server called tavern that I am in. The idea for the project has beena long time in the making of wanting to make a discord bot 
                                but I never quite had the right idea of what to make. Then discord added and integration with league where you could sign in and it would make weekly scoreboards for certian stats. we quickly blew through all of the availible
                                options so I had the idea of making a Discord bot that had more options.

                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                This was a very fun project to work on and was great to be able to share with my friends when done. First I started by creating a script that could connect to the riot api and pull information for a player. Next I set up a Google 
                                Sheets api so that I could store all the information in a way that would make it easy for my friends to go in and see all the data instead of just the scoreboards that I would display in Discord. The next part was the most time intensive 
                                as I had to connect the two and then add the Discord integration.

                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                When deploying the bot to my friends, I learned a lot about the unpredictibility of a live environment and the beauty of beta testing. Sometimes as a coder it is hard to imagine how a normal user will try to use the code that you have 
                                worked on for so long simply because it is so familiar to you. It is like trying to imagine learning to ride a bike again, you can get the majority but will always miss some small feeling. After a couple bug fixes, I believe this to be a 
                                complete and working project that I am glad I did.

                                This Project is a fully functional website that I built from scratch to serve as a portfolio to share my personal coding projects with the world. This Project was coded from scratch using Html, CSS and JaveScript and was my first 
                                project that utilized these languages. It consist of 3 pages: A home page that has contact information and an About Me section, A projects page where you are veiwing this now that has a discription picture of each project that I 
                                have made along with what I learned from the project and finally a Travel page where I write blogs about my recent travels and vacations that I have went on.
                            </p>
                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                Being one of my first personal projects, there were unique challenges that presented themselves as I worked on the website. When beginning the project the thing I thought would be the biggest obstacle would be motivation since there 
                                was no real deadline of when it needed to be completed by. I thought that I was lose interest in the project and it would fall to the wayside. However that proved not to be an issue. I found it exciting to learn the new languages and
                                work on something where the progress was so easily visible. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="Margins-auto">
                                I learned how to be more effective in searching for help online and grew in my ability to learn on my own which I believe to be an important skill. I also gained a new appreciation for taking a break from the project and coming back 
                                with a fresh prospective. There were many times where I couldn't find the way to format a section and then I took a break for 15 minutes as I went for a walk or grabbed a snack and then when I came back I was able to solve the problem
                                almost immediately.
