                                                and was my first project that utilized these languages. It consist of 3 pages: A home page that has contact information and an About Me section, A projects page where you are veiwing this now that has a discription 
                                                picture of each project that I have made along with what I learned form the project and finally a Travel page where I write blogs about my recent travels and vacations that I go on.
